#v0.1 'drunken monkey'

- POC, support add, take, occupy, put, update, show, _restart and halp commands
- simple parser that explodes in your face for no reasons
- accepts bot-start tag in the middle of the text

#v0.2 'happy gorilla'

- better command line parser
- support for quoted argument values
- enforces bot-name-tag must be the first non-whitespace token in the message (or bot will ignore it)
- added timestamp the box was taken by a user (so you can act if someone keeps a box for a long, long time)
- add header line for output of cmd show
